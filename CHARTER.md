# The Alexandria Charter

## I. Purpose
Alexandria exists to collect, preserve, expand, and freely transmit human knowledge
for the benefit of humanity across generations.

## II. The Archive
The Archive is the core and highest priority of Alexandria.

All works accepted into the Archive shall be digitally copied, redundantly stored,
and rendered inviolable.

Once archived, knowledge may not be destroyed, altered, or removed.
Annotations may be added for context or correction without modifying the original.

## III. Institutional Separation
Alexandria distinguishes between preservation, access, education, and invention.
These functions shall never be merged in a way that compromises preservation.

## IV. Governance (Future)
Alexandria shall be governed by independent councils corresponding to its functions.
No council may override the preservation mandate of the Archive.

## V. Independence
Alexandria shall not be governed by any nation, corporation, or individual.
No donor or sponsor may exert control over archive content or governance.

## VI. Funding
Alexandria may accept donations, grants, or capped-return investments in the future.
No perpetual ownership or control rights shall ever be granted.

## VII. Amendment
This Charter may be amended only through rigorous consensus.
The inviolability of the Archive is not subject to amendment.
