# Inviolability Principle

Once knowledge is accepted into the Alexandria Archive:

- It shall not be deleted.
- It shall not be altered.
- It shall not be overwritten.
- It shall not be withdrawn.

Corrections, context, and disputes may be added only as annotations,
clearly separated from the original material.

The purpose of inviolability is to preserve human knowledge against
political, economic, and cultural erasure.

This principle supersedes all other institutional concerns.
